# DSC-DYPCOE ML-Track

Hello there üëãüèº This community and repository is created with the spirit of helping anyone break into AI and working with the DSC Chapter to build a community of AI Enthusiasts right here 
in DYPCOE. Resources include course/blog/tutorial/research paper links as well as prospective project ideas.

### Before you jump right into the resources
- Make sure you have a clear idea of the jargons - **Machine Learning**, **Artifical Intelligence**,**Data Science**. To clear that up watch [this](https://youtu.be/k2P_pHQDlp0) video from Krish Naik.
- Have a reason why you want to enter into this field.
- Don't get stuck in the MOOC cycle, while & after learning, do projects, write blogs. Stay Curious.
