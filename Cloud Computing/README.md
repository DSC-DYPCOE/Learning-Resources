Hello there 👋🏼 This community and repository is created with the spirit of helping anyone break into cloud computing and working 
with the DSC Chapter to build a community of Cloud Enthusiasts right here in DYPCOE. Hope you are excited !!!
#### Before you jump right into the resources, you need to know some things :
##### What is _Cloud_ ????
      Cloud is a set of tools that allow developer's use less time managing and spend more time creating.
##### How is GCP different than Azure and AWS ?

##### How companies use GCP ?
* **PayPal** needed a faster network, increased security, and a future-oriented platform to allow them to develop new services for their global customers. This is how they partnered with Google Cloud to get there.
**Sri Shivananda**, Chief Technology Officer,PayPal says :
>"We turned to Google as our cloud provider because it has the fastest network in terms of throughput, bandwidth, and latency.Its global backbone is also vital for us because we >operate in hundreds of countries around the world."

### SERVICES 
* #### COMPUTE Service:
Compute Engine lets you create and run **virtual machines** on Google infrastructure. Compute Engine offers scale, performance, and value that lets you easily launch large compute clusters on Google's infrastructure.There are no upfront investments, and you can run thousands of virtual CPUs on a system that offers quick, consistent performance.

* #### STORAGE:
Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving
website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

Store **objects** with global edge caching : [Doc](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/concepts)

Add **block storage** to VM instances : [Doc](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks)
* #### NETWORKING:
  * **Load balancer** -
   It is used to distribute the load traffic evenly on different servers. For more info [click here](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs)
  * **Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** -
   It provides networking functionality to Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances, Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE) containers,and the App Engine flexible environment.
   VPC provides networking for your cloud-based services that is global, scalable, and flexible. For more info [click here](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs)
  * **Cloud DNS** -
   It is used to publish and manage your domain names using Google's reliable, resilient, low-latency DNS serving. For more info [click here](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs)
 * #### SECURITY:
   * [Shielding VM](https://cloud.google.com/security/shielded-cloud/shielded-vm)
   * [Manage Encryption keys on cloud](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs)
 * #### IDENTITY and ACCESS MANAGEMENT IAM
 This lets you create and manage permissions for Google Cloud resources. [Click here for more info](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs)
### OPERATIONS 
* **CLOUD LOGGING** :
  Cloud Logging allows you to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on logging data and events from Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.
