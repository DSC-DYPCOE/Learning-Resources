# AR/VR Community DSC-DYPCOE 
Hello there üëãüèº This community and repository is created with the spirit of helping anyone break into Augmented reality and working with the DSC Chapter to build a community of AR/VR Enthusiasts right here in DYPCOE. Resources include course/blog/tutorial/research paper links as well as prospective project ideas.

## WHAT IS AUGMENTED REALITY (AR)?
Augmented reality (AR) adds digital content onto a live camera feed, making that digital content look as if it is part of the physical world around you.   

In practice, this could be anything from making your face look like a giraffe to overlaying digital directions onto the physical streets around you. Augmented reality can let you see how furniture would look in your living room, or play a digital board game on a cereal box. All these examples require understanding the physical world from the camera feed, i.e. the AR system must understand what is where in the world before adding relevant digital content at the right place. 

## What Is VR (Virtual Reality)?
Virtual reality is able to transpose the user. In other words, bring us some place else. Through closed visors or goggles, VR blocks out the room and puts our presence elsewhere.
