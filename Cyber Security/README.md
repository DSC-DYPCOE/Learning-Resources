What is Cyber Security in Web Applications ?
Web application security is the process of protecting websites and online services against different security threats that exploit vulnerabilities in an application’s code.

So now you might have also got a question like what is vulnerabilities and what are the types of vulnerabilities?
Vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a threat actor, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a computer system.
There is a global community of Web app security **OWASP - "The Open Web Application Security Project"** which looks on upon the top vulnerabilities and release them according to their severity the top 10 **OWASP** vulnerabilities in 2020 are
1. Injection
2. Broken Authentication
3. Sensitive Data Exposure
4. XML External Entities (XXE)
5. Broken Access Control
6. Security Misconfiguration
7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure Deserialization
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

### Bug-Bounty Hunting
Bug bounty hunters are ethical hackers who make a hobby (or, even a business) of finding security issues or bugs in an online businesses. Rather than misuse it, these hackers, in a responsible manner, disclose it to the firm.
Many websites offer a **Bug Bounty Program:** A bug bounty program is a deal offered by many websites, organizations and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to security exploits and vulnerabilities.

### Catch The Flag (CTF)
A capture the flag (CTF) contest is a special kind of cybersecurity competition designed to challenge its participants to solve computer security problems and/or capture and defend computer systems. Typically, these competitions are team-based and attract a diverse range of participants, including students, enthusiasts and professionals. A CTF competition may take a few short hours, an entire day or even multiple days.

CTF competitions have elevated from their humble roots to reach sport-level status, with thousands of individual games and leagues now taking place every year across the globe — including the annual DEF CON competition, one of the most prestigious CTF events in the world.
