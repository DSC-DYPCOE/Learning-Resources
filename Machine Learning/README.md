# DSC-DYPCOE Machine Learning ü§ñ    

Hello there üëãüèº. Thank youüòÄ for choosing this track. Let us help you break into this field. This community and repository is created with the spirit of helping anyone break into AI and working with the DSC Chapter to build a community of AI Enthusiasts right here in DYPCOE. These Resources include online courses, books and roadmaps.

### Before you jump right into the resources
- Make sure you have a clear idea of the jargons - **Machine Learning**, **Artifical Intelligence**,**Data Science**.To clear that up watch [this](https://youtu.be/k2P_pHQDlp0) video from Krish Naik.
- Have a reason why you want to enter into this field.
- Don't get stuck in the MOOC cycle, while & after learning, do projects, write blogs. Stay Curious.

As you might have seen from the video, what do those terms mean, you might have a slight idea of what is this field actually. So to start off, There's **never** a clear pathway to start. Just like everyone has different tastes for food, similarly for resources. You just have to try and find out what works best for you. Down here I have listed various resources, ofcourse you don't have to follow all of them, these are just the ones that I have found pretty useful on my journey and various others.
